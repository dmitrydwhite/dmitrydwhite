## 👋 Hi I'm Dmitry!

At work, I like things like JavaScript and TypeScript, React, Node.js, Python, intuitive and delightful user experiences, and Space Exploration. My hobbies are spending time with my family, backpacking, HAM radio, and tinkering with IoT gizmos like Arduinos and Raspberry Pis.

I live in a 125-year-old farmhouse in Silverton, Oregon. We are recently extremely excited about our new wood stove and our 7 chickens 🐓...🥚
