## 👋 Hi I'm Dmitry!

At work, I like things like JavaScript, React, NodeJS, and Space Exploration. My hobbies are spending time with my family, backpacking, HAM radio, and tinkering with IoT gizmos like Arduinos and Raspberry Pis.

I live in a 120-year-old farmhouse in Silverton, Oregon. We are recently extremely excited about our new wood stove and our 17 chickens 🐓...🥚
